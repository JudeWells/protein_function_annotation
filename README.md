# protein_function_annotation
Look for protein domains (identified by Chainsaw) that might have novel functional annotations

Take as input a directory full of predicted Chainsaw domains (in the form of pdb files)
Extract the uniprot code for each pdb file
Extract the residue numbers and sequence associated with the predicted protein domain
Search for functional annotations on those domains
